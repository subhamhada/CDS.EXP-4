# Experiment 4
## Aim - 
To write C++ programs that demonstrate the use of bitwise operators.
## Theory - 
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of data. They are essential for tasks that involve low-level progrmming, such as manipulating binary data and performing bitwise arithmetic.
The common bitwise operators in C++ include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>).

### Bitwise AND (&):

Performs a bitwise AND operation between two integers. If both the bits are 1 then the result of the operation is 1 otherwise the result bit is 0.

### Bitwise OR (|):

Performs a bitwise OR operation.If atleast one of the bits is 1 then the result of the operation is 1.

### Bitwise XOR (^):

Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation. If both the bits are different the result of the operation is 1 otherwise the result bit is 0.

### Bitwise NOT (~):

Performs a bitwise NOT operation, also known as bitwise complement. It inverts all the bits. The result of the bit is complimentary to itself, for example if a bit is 1 its result bit is 0.

### Left Shift (<<):

Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the right operand. New bits on the right are set to 0.

### Right Shift (>>):

Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the right operand. The behavior of the leftmost bits depends on whether the type is signed or unsigned.
